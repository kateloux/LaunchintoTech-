                    <h2> Kate Gay </h2>
                    Hello, and welcome to my inaugural web page! I'm Kate, and I recently made a bold yet life-changing decision to transition into the tech industry. With a penchant for design and a knack for problem-solving, I've found a natural fit in coding and web design. My passion for technology stems from its potential to positively impact our lives, whether it's automating tasks like adjusting the thermostat when we leave the house or enhancing user experiences while hunting for budget-friendly hotels.

                    Before diving into tech, I worked as a Clinical Lead in a care home for women with complex needs. While some might see this as a far cry from web design, I see parallels. My days were spent collaborating in multidisciplinary teams, devising tailored interventions for clients based on their goals and needs. Just as I prioritised understanding and meeting the needs of those I worked with in the care setting, I recognise the importance of user-centric design in crafting websites that are usable, accessible, and aligned with client objectives.

                    Empathy and a passion for creation are at the core of who I am, making me confident that with continued technical development, I'll excel as a web developer.
