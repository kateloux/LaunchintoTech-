                    <h2> Kate Gay </h2>
                    I am currently seeking a role in software development where I will have the opportunity to  build on my current skills. My previous professional experiences have enabled me to develop many transferable skills relevant to the role of a web developer.

                    <BR>
                    For example, I have excellent communication skills, yearned by my ability to lead and work as part of a team whilst under high pressure. Due to the unpredictable nature of working in mental health, I am adept in problem solving. This is also a skill I have enjoyed putting to the test whilst writing code during the coding academy. I have excellent attention to detail, developed through completing statistical analysis and research during my MSc.

                    My previous roles have required me to empathise with client's, and understand their needs in order to devise the most suitable solution; these are skills that are also particularly important when considering the design of websites to ensure usability and accessibility.
